      I didn't come here to hear me
What's that?
I didn't come here to hear me
Let's do you then
Yes, oh, my God
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel about her
In my heart?
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?
'Cause I've lost love ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
And now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes
